{"name":"Drawio","tagline":"Source to www.draw.io","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jgraph/drawio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jgraph/drawio)\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n[diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net), [previously draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/move-diagrams-net), is an online diagramming web site that delivers the source in this project.\r\n\r\ndiagrams.net uses the [mxGraph library](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph) as the base of the stack, with the [GraphEditor example](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph/tree/master/javascript/examples/grapheditor) from mxGraph as the base of the application part. The mxGraph library build used is stored under /etc/mxgraph/mxClient.js.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\ndiagrams.net is licensed under the Apache v2.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nA development guide is being started on the GitHub project wiki. There is a [draw.io](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/draw.io) tag on Stack Overflow currently, please make sure any questions adhere to their guidelines for questions.\r\n\r\nThe [mxGraph documentation](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/) provides a lot of the docs for the bottom part of the stack. There is an [mxgraph tag on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mxgraph).\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\nOne way to run diagrams.net is to fork this project, [publish the master branch to GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and the [pages sites](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).\r\n\r\nAnother way is to use [the recommended Docker project](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio) or to download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net).\r\n\r\nThe full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).\r\n\r\nSupported Browsers\r\n------------------\r\ndiagrams.net supports IE 11, Chrome 70+, Firefox 70+, Safari 11+, Opera 50+, Native Android browser 7x+, the default browser in the current and previous major iOS versions (e.g. 11.2.x and 10.3.x) and Edge 79+.","note":"Don't delete this file!
